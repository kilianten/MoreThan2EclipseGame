# MoreThan2EclipseGame
I created this simple 2D game compeletely from scratch purely using Java. The game engine works and it has basic mechanics implemented, the ability to walk using AWSD keys & shoot using the G key.
Although the game is very bare, I was proud that I learned to render graphics and make a working game. As I was tweaking the collision I had to postpone the development to focus on college work, however, I intend to return to this project some day.
